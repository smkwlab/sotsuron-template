# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the sotsuron-template repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **unified thesis template** for Kyushu Sangyo University, supporting both undergraduate (卒業論文) and graduate (修士論文) theses. It provides a comprehensive LaTeX template with automated workflows, review systems, and integration with the thesis-environment ecosystem. Students use this template to create their individual thesis repositories through automated tools.

## Key Commands

### LaTeX Compilation
```bash
# Undergraduate thesis compilation
latexmk -pv sotsuron.tex      # Main thesis document
latexmk -pv gaiyou.tex        # Abstract (概要)

# Graduate thesis compilation  
latexmk -pv thesis.tex        # Main thesis document
latexmk -pv abstract.tex      # Abstract

# Cleanup commands
latexmk -c                    # Clean auxiliary files
latexmk -C                    # Clean all generated files including PDF

# Direct compilation (if needed)
platex sotsuron.tex           # Undergraduate main document
platex thesis.tex             # Graduate main document
pbibtex sotsuron              # Bibliography for undergraduate
pbibtex thesis                # Bibliography for graduate
```

### Text Quality Checking
```bash
# textlint for Japanese academic writing
textlint *.tex                # Check all .tex files
textlint --fix *.tex          # Auto-fix issues where possible
textlint sotsuron.tex         # Check specific file

# Example file checking
textlint example.tex          # Check example content
textlint example-gaiyou.tex   # Check example abstract
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Test with different engines
latexmk -pdf sotsuron.tex     # Force PDF mode
latexmk -dvi sotsuron.tex     # Force DVI mode

# Bibliography testing
pbibtex sotsuron && latexmk sotsuron.tex  # Manual bib processing
```

## Architecture

### Template Structure
The repository supports both thesis types with smart file organization:

**Undergraduate (卒業論文) files:**
- `sotsuron.tex` - Main thesis document
- `gaiyou.tex` - Abstract in Japanese
- `example.tex` - Example content for reference
- `example-gaiyou.tex` - Example abstract

**Graduate (修士論文) files:**
- `thesis.tex` - Main thesis document  
- `abstract.tex` - Abstract (English or Japanese)

**Shared files:**
- `plistings.sty` - Programming code formatting
- `.latexmkrc` - LaTeX compilation configuration
- `.textlintrc` - Japanese writing quality rules

### Student Repository Creation
Students create individual repositories using automated Docker-based tools:

```bash
# Self-service repository creation (zero dependencies)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smkwlab/thesis-management-tools/main/create-repo/setup.sh)"

# With student ID for automatic thesis type detection
STUDENT_ID=k21rs001 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smkwlab/thesis-management-tools/main/create-repo/setup.sh)"
```

### Automated File Cleanup
Based on student ID patterns:
- **k??rs???** (undergraduate): Keeps `sotsuron.tex`, `gaiyou.tex`, `example*.tex`
- **k??gjk??** (graduate): Keeps `thesis.tex`, `abstract.tex` only

### Review Workflow System
Sophisticated GitHub Actions-based supervision system:

**Branching Strategy:**
- Sequential draft branches: `0th-draft` → `1st-draft` → `2nd-draft` → ...
- Persistent `review-branch` for holistic feedback
- Base `initial` branch for clean diff tracking

**Faculty Review Features:**
- Individual draft PRs for incremental changes
- Comprehensive review PR showing entire thesis
- GitHub suggestions for direct edits
- Automated branch creation for next drafts

## Important Conventions

### Student ID Pattern Recognition
The system automatically detects thesis type:

**Undergraduate patterns:**
- `k??rs???` (e.g., k21rs001, k23rs099)
- Receives: `sotsuron.tex`, `gaiyou.tex`, examples

**Graduate patterns:**  
- `k??gjk??` (e.g., k21gjk01, k23gjk15)
- Receives: `thesis.tex`, `abstract.tex` only

### Document Structure Standards
**Undergraduate thesis (sotsuron.tex):**
- Introduction (はじめに)
- Literature Review (関連研究)
- Methodology (提案手法)
- Experiments (実験)
- Discussion (考察)
- Conclusion (おわりに)

**Graduate thesis (thesis.tex):**
- More comprehensive structure
- Research background
- Detailed methodology
- Extensive experiments
- Academic contributions

### Japanese Academic Writing
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 throughout
- **Style**: Academic dearu-調 (断定調)
- **Length**: Undergraduate ~20-30 pages, Graduate ~40-60 pages
- **Citations**: Academic format with proper bibliography

## Development Workflow

## Student Workflow (for reference)

### Phase 1: Thesis Writing
```
0th-draft (outline) → 1st-draft → 2nd-draft → ... → submit tag
```

### Phase 2: Abstract Writing
```
abstract-1st → abstract-2nd → abstract completion
```

### Phase 3: Final Submission
```
Further improvements → Final PR → Faculty approval → final-* tag → Auto-merge to main
```

### Branch Management for Students
- **Work branches**: Students create drafts in sequence
- **Review branch**: Automatically updated with latest content

```

### Integration Testing
- Test repository creation with sample student IDs
- Verify file cleanup for both thesis types
- Test devcontainer functionality
- Validate GitHub Actions workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation errors:**
- Check file encoding (must be UTF-8)
- Verify Japanese font availability
- Test with minimal document first
- Check .latexmkrc configuration

**textlint issues:**
- Validate .textlintrc syntax
- Check rule compatibility with content
- Test with example files
- Update textlint rules if needed

**Repository creation problems:**
- Verify student ID format
- Check Docker availability
- Test with debug mode: `DEBUG=1`
- Validate GitHub authentication

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check LaTeX installation
kpsewhich jarticle.cls          # Japanese article class
kpsewhich plistings.sty         # Custom style file

# Test Japanese processing
echo "日本語テスト" | platex     # Basic Japanese test

# Check textlint configuration  
npx textlint --print-config     # Show active rules
```

## MCP Tools Usage

### GitHub Operations
Use MCP tools instead of `gh` command for GitHub operations:
- **Development**: Use `mcp__gh-toshi__*` tools for development work
- **Student testing**: Use `mcp__gh-k19__*` tools only when testing student workflows

### Shell Command Gotchas

#### Backticks in gh pr create/edit
When using `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit` with `--body`, backticks (`) in the body text are interpreted as command substitution by the shell. This causes errors like:
```
permission denied: .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
command not found: 2025c-test
```

**Solution**: Always escape backticks with backslashes when using them in PR bodies:
```bash
# Wrong - will cause errors
gh pr create --body "Updated `file.txt` to version `1.2.3`"

# Correct - escaped backticks
gh pr create --body "Updated \`file.txt\` to version \`1.2.3\`"
```
